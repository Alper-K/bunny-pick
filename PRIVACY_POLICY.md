# Privacy Policy for Bunny Pick | Color Picker

**Last Updated: October 17, 2025**

Thank you for using Bunny Pick | Color Picker ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.

### 1. Data We Do Not Collect

We believe in privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. This includes:

* Your name, email address, or age.
* Your location or IP address.
* Your web browsing history.
* Authentication information like passwords.
* Any other personal data.

### 2. Data We Use

The only data the Extension interacts with is stored locally on your own computer and is never sent to us or any third party. This includes:

* **Color History:** To provide you with a history of colors you have picked, the Extension uses the `chrome.storage.local` API. This data is stored only in your browser on your device and can be cleared by you at any time.
* **User Settings:** Any settings you configure for the Extension are also saved locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`.

### 3. Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions to function correctly:

* **`activeTab`**: This allows the eyedropper tool to work on the current webpage when you activate the Extension. It does not grant access to your browser history.
* **`clipboardWrite`**: This allows the Extension to copy the selected color code to your clipboard when you click the "Copy" button.
* **`storage`**: This is used to save your color history and settings locally on your computer.

### 4. Open-Source
